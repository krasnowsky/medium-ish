# medium-ish

Project created for the sake of recruitment process for the Junior Python Developer in Optimo Development.

Stack:
-Django
-Bootstrap

Source catalog contains requirements.txt file allowing to install all necessary libraries at once.

Everything is packed withing blog app due to the fact that the scope of this project is rather small, therefore, I found distrubuting everything into seperate apps unecessary.
